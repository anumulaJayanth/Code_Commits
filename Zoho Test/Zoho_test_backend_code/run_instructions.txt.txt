I have created two folders for this Application one folder has Frontend code and another folder has backend code

Zoho_test_backend_code Folder:

1. In this folder I have created api's using nodejs
2. Open the command prompt inside the folder and run command : npm i (To get the packages)
3. After running above command you will get node modules folder please check whether you got that folder or not
4. After verifying please run command : npm run dev
5. After running above command all the api's which I have created will be activated please keep this command prompt like that only and open another folder (Zoho_test_Frontend_code Folder)

Zoho_test_Frontend_code Folder:

1. Dont close the above folder command prompt open new command prompt for this folder because We will get api's from that folder.
2. After opening the new command prompt run command : npm i
3. After running above command run : npm start 
4. After running the npm start command the Application will be running on localhost:4200 Please verify the application on localhost:4200
